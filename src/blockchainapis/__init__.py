"""
The blockchainapis package allow you to interact with Blockchain
APIs in a synchronous and asynchronous way.

If you are starting on a new project, it is better to use the async
class, which is called: BlockchainAPIs

If you already have a project and don't want to bother with async,
you can use the BlockchainAPIsSync class.
